2. Assumption math opperations :1234:  for many Numbers <a href="https://github.com/huseyindalbudak/mathpy/blob/master/gamesAlgorithms/islemGames.py" target="_blank"> islemGames.py</a>
For Example: the sample is *4 | 8 | 3 | 6 | 2 | 60*  --> you should find *987* with math opperations. 
the solution: 
<li>2*8 =16 </li>
<li>16*60 = 960  </li>
<li>6*4 = 24 </li>
<li>24+3 = 27  </li>
<li>960+27 = 987 </li>

3.  :1234: <a href="https://github.com/huseyindalbudak/mathpy/blob/master/gamesAlgorithms/sudoku3x3.py" target="_blank"> sudoku3x3.py</a>

the codes is wrote for a 3x3 sudoku games
 rules: 
 - there are one 2D matrix. 
 - Row and col has not same number that are from 1 to 9.
 - the 3x3 matrix has not same number.
 - In additon to, if we know a number in the matrix, it should contunie properly with it.
method:
 - we full the matrix with random numbers   
- if we know many number in the 3x3 sudo matrix, the program works properly with new function.
